          <p>In Sportfest 2024, I was part of the Blue Team under Ma’am Maricel and Ma’am Mayveline. They had high hopes that we would win, especially the graduating HRS team, but overconfidence led to our loss. Despite that, I still received the Mythical 6 award.
            Then, in Sportfest 2025, we finally became champions! It was exhausting, but worth it. My coaches pushed me hard, even joking (or half-threatening) that I had to win MVP—and I did! It was an intense but incredibly rewarding experience, and I’ll never forget the joy of that victory.</p>

          <p>STI Alaminos helped me build my self-confidence. Before, I was shy and unsure of myself, but through various activities, performances, and interactions, I learned to believe in my abilities. The people I met—my classmates, friends, and even our amazing instructors—played a big role in shaping who I am today. Some of my happiest memories come from simple moments of laughter and bonding with my classmates, whether during breaks, group projects, or school events. The instructors were also incredibly supportive, pushing us to do our best while making learning fun. Because of STI, I not only gained knowledge but also lifelong memories and the courage to face new challenges with confidence.</p>
